# The Beloved's Blog Astro

This the `HTML` template of my latest project: my personal blogging portal.

## About this project

This project is built in [Astro SSG](https://astro.build/).

I chanced upon this technology through [Kevin Powell's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7iQAF2EvUU&t=1193s) on YouTube.

Astro SSG sits nicely between pure `HTML` sites and full SPA libraries like React or Angular.
It allows you to build a static site with reusable components like a navbar without the complexity of a full SPA library.

## Commands

Run

```
npm run preview
```

And go to `localhost:3000` to view this project.
